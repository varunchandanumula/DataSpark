# DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics
## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive process of cleaning, merging, and analyzing customer, sales, exchange rate, and store data. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide of the workflow followed:

## Step 0: Collecting all the files
Create folder with all the csv files to run the python file in the same folder
## Step 1: Data Cleaning
* Reading the Data:
Utilized Python and Pandas to read the CSV files for customers, sales, exchange rates, and stores.
* Handling Missing Values:
Identified and filled null values using appropriate methods.
* Data Type Conversion:
Converted columns to their respective data types (e.g., dates, integers, floats).
## Step 2: Data Merging
* Merging Datasets:
Merged all cleaned data into a single DataFrame using the Pandas merge function with the inner join method.
## Step 3: Uploading Data to SQL
* Connecting to SQL Database:
Established a connection to the SQL database using SQLAlchemy.
* Pushing Data to SQL:
Pushed the cleaned and merged DataFrame to the SQL database named capstone.
## Step 4: Data Analysis with SQL
* Writing SQL Queries:
Created SQL queries to analyze customer, sales, product, and store data.
## Step 5: Data Visualization with Power BI
* Uploading Queries:
Uploaded the results of each SQL query into Power BI.
* Creating Visualizations:
Created visualizations to present insights from the data analysis.
